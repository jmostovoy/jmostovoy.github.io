<h2 id="website_statment">This (sub-) website was created for the purpose of orginizing and reporting on progress on the devolpment and implementation of Phase 1 for TCI's ML Reporting Software.</h2>

<h3 id="plan_and_progress_reports">Please find below a progress report and overall plan:</h3>
    
<ul>
  <li> Monday April 24: Conduct a literature review of relevant deep learning networks; continue with data extraction from sql database.</li>
  <li> Tuesday April 25: Continue with data extraction from sql database, begin data cleaning. </li>
  <li> Wednesday April 26: Continue with data cleaning/orginization. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="list_of_requirements"> Here's a (working) list of programs we're either going to have to adapt from a package, or create. This list is also compileted in chronological order - I.e., it is recommended to work on developing the first Incomplete program listed. </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Automatic Downloading from Website | Status = COMPLETE </li>
  <li> Mass File Unzipping Software (Capable of unzipping 24,000 files at once) | Status = NOT STARTED </li>
  <li> Automatic matching function for pdf files and unzipped client data files | Status = NOT STARTED </li>
  <li> Reading PDFs and extracting certain data - most importantly TH-score and explanation for said score. Also should extract client name, DOB, date of examination, etc. | Status = STARTED (very elementary learning how to read PDFs) </li>
  <li> Extract necessary images for each patient and put into format easy for analysis | Status = NOT STARTED </li>
  <li> Extract additional patient indicators from their personal docs storred in (now unzipped) files  | Status = NOT STARTED </li>
  <li> Create lists which contain the following information orginized by report #: client name, DOB, images, patient indicators, etc. | Status = NOT STARTED </li>
  <li> Create different model based on the now well orginized list, test against TH-score fitting accuracy | Status = NOT STARTED </li>
  <li> Create different highly specified models which are able to predict TH-score explanations | Status = NOT STARTED </li>
  <li> Create a Neural Network to optimize and specify which of the above tests to use and how to use them properly for an over TH-score and score explanation | Status = NOT STARTED </li>
  <li> Determine if overall model works "well enough", and continue iff it does, otherwise revisit previous 3 steps | Status = NOT STARTED </li>
  <li> Automating the report writing given a new system for inputs from clinics, and our now finished model (likely on LaTeX with the support of Amazon Web Services to run our likely R program constantly) | Status = NOT STARTED </li>
</ul>
